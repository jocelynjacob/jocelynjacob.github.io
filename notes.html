    With an election coming up soon, I wanted to post all the notes I took from reading Kevin Rudd’s autobiography two years ago. Talking about politics now slightly kills my soul so please don’t message me about any of this if it’s not out of good faith. I just think (and really hope) it will be helpful to anyone unsure about who to vote for - underlining what our parties represent historically and their exact records to show for it. <br>
    •	With all economic crises, the ultimate price would be paid by honest working men and women, losing their jobs and their livelihoods through forces beyond their comprehension and control. Which is why I believe... governments can and must intervene when unfettered markets rampage across the lives of the innocent. (pg 83)<br>
    •	When resources were available to broaden educational opportunity, his hankering for a return to the good old days under the gum trees wasn’t really the point anymore. As for any concern for the environment, this was dismissed as crypto-communism. (pg 132) on Liberal Qld Premier Johannes Bjelke-Peterson<br>
    •	The conservatives desperately wanted us to take the bait, thereby diverting the campaign from debates on corruption, future economic management, education, health and the environment. (pg 148)<br>
    •	“Why should the conservatives have a monopoly on God?” (pg 148)<br>
    Reform introduced by Goss Govt (pg 153) <br>

      o	Ended logging on Fraser Island and turned into a national park<br>

      o	Initiated Hospital Re-Building Program Plan<br>

      o	National Asian language program (ceased under Howard)<br>
    •	It is often assumed amid the sound and fury of populist politics that a ‘no change’ option is somehow cost-free. It never is. (pg 178)<br>
    •	The politics of race was once again legitimised as part of our national conversation. (pg 189)<br>
    •	The use of the power of the state either for the many or the few remains the core question of politics. However elegantly our conservative opponents may seek to soften, obscure or evade it... The modern state is a powerful institution... Its power is articulated through the military, security, the justice system, the regulation of markets, the collection and redistribution of taxes, the funding of social and economic programs, and the protection of the environment. The state, and who controls it, therefore affects all our lives, for good or for ill. And despite all the fashionable chatter about political convergence around a mystical place called ‘the centre’, this is the core reason why elections still matter fundamentally for us all. (pg 213)<br>
    •	Conservatives rarely argue in terms of their own project. They almost universally argue against the project of others. And that’s because arguing the case of the few against the many is not just rotten values, it’s rotten politics. (pg 214)<br>
    •	The business of Christianity, as I see it, is to lay down a daily ethical challenge to all of us on how we use our public and private lives for the many and not for the few, rather than some public exercise in religious self-validation. (pg 216)<br>
    •	When confronted with rational argument, or ethical imperatives informed from the Christian tradition... their response was usually to wrap themselves in a cocktail of God, tradition and Menzies, before resorting to the safer political terrain of naked fear, patriotic emotion, and the coarser forms of what in time we would call ‘identity politics’. (pg 217)<br>
    •	Australia’s lack of individual discretion in the East Timorese Crisis caused the Indonesia government to cease cooperation with them in handling incoming refugees.<br>
    •	The Downer Doctrine: economic engagement with Asian countries is fine whereas cultural, political or strategic engagement was impossible. (pg 261)<br>
    •	He had brought together all the necessary ingredients to transform the election agenda from a domestic debate about health, education, jobs and tax, which he would lose, to one about race, religion, refugees and the ‘security’ of our national borders, which he would win. (pg 269)<br>
    •	It is an uncomfortable fact that of the 69,000 Muslim asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat over the last twenty years, not one is known to have been accused or convicted of a terrorist act. (pg 273)<br>
    •	The governments response was to demonise asylum seekers as subhuman. ‘Officials say the refugees have been throwing children off the boat to force the Navy to rescue them.’ This is precisely what officials had been saying... The only problem was that it was completely false. (pg 274)<br>
    •	A compassionate Australia meant that our values of a fair go for all did not mystically stop at the continental shelf. (pg 285)<br>
    •	Howard instituted an inquiry into the government's possession of 'any special intelligence' with no terms of reference to the overall intelligence in Australia's possession on the emerging terrorist threat. He continued to limit reference over policy failure in Iraq and the Cole Inquiry (where the govt siphoned 300 million dollars to Saddam Hussein through the Australian Wheat Board) (pg 298)<br>
    •	Howard argued that there was clear evidence of Iraq's possession of chemical weapons in his reasons for Australia's participation in the Iraq War. It was later revealed from the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security that Howard had access to public reports filed by several defence and intelligence organisations that concluded with the contrary. (pg 306-308)<br>
    •	If you were going to blow a country apart for political reasons, in my view you also bore the moral responsibility to put it back together again. (pg 325)<br>
    •	In politics, whether domestic or foreign, it's important to honour your word (pg 364), → ensuring local health clinics in Afghanistan were properly equipped and installed a battery of solar panels to handle the problem of chronic power shortages.<br>
    •	Jesus taught that faith was not just a matter of private piety but of active social action to bring about justice in this life, not only the next.<br>
    •	WorkChoices reduced the choices available to working families in virtually every respect, from industrial awards, the imposition of individual contracts, the mechanism for determining the minimum wage, the ability to bargain collectively, protection from unfair dismissal and the rights of unions. Put simply, Howard's new law was about shifting power within the workplaces in the direction of the employer. Hundreds of cases would emerge of vulnerable young workers being exploited right across the country (pg 398) being paid as little as three dollars an hour. (pg 484)<br>
    •	Howard's core public justification for the legislation was a productivity argument, though he brought no evidence to the debate on this, just ideology. They couldn't explain why productivity growth had been so strong under the last Labor govt when enterprise bargaining was first introduced which had encouraged firms to invest in innovation, technology and R&D in turn increasing per-unit labour output, resulting in Australia's best productivity numbers only to begin declining again during the middle years of the Howard govt. Howard ignored the evidence that collective bargaining, properly executed, was a productivity-enhancing measure. (pg 398)<br>
    •	Howard lied about the contents of Rudd's letter when he implicated it for the suggestion to breach the election commitment, he had previously made to not raise the troops ceiling. (pg 400)<br>
    •	Howard's grand strategy of using the invasion of Iraq to deter the North Koreans from developing their own nuclear capability had just exploded in his, and the world's, face. (pg 401)<br>
    •	The Australian govt received several warnings of the dealings which they chose to ignore and the AWB was plainly aware of the breach and dealings. (pg 410-411)<br>
    •	A cash-strapped Hussein was able to draw on $220 million USD delivered to him from Australia to buy military equipment on the international market for later use against Australia. (pg 422)<br>
    •	Whether it is 'family values', the notion of 'community service' or the emphasis on 'tradition' in the history wars, 'traditional conservative values' are being demolished by an unrestrained market capitalism that sweeps all before it. The contradiction within the political Right is as old as liberalism and conservatism themselves: the ruthless logic of the market rubbing up against a tradition which holds that those with economic power have a moral obligation to protect those without it. (pg 430)<br>
    •	In the conservative political repertoire, the key thing on the economy, as on national security, is to bring about maximum anxiety and fear, regardless of the evidence, because in the business of psychological warfare, fear will almost always triumph over any competing positive aspiration. (pg 454)<br>
    •	The core problem was that both Howard's expenditure binge in the latter years of his govt, in addition to the series of tax cuts over as many years, were largely masked at the time by a temporary company tax windfall resulting from the mining boom from 2003. (pg 460)<br>
    •	According to the PBO (Parliamentary Budget Office), Australia begun a structural budget (income and expenditure in consideration of macroeconomic circumstances, e.g. booms, recessions) deficit before the GFC due to Howard's reckless spending. (pg 462-463)<br>
    •	A rumour becomes a charge which must then be publicly denied, thereby translating a word-of-mouth allegation into a legitimate issue in the public debate. (pg 475)<br>
    •	The conservatives preferred modus operandi was invariably to pin 'a bead' on their opponent's character, ethics or morality, to work on it over time, until it became a running sore in the public's mind. (pg 475)<br>
    •	The Liberals were always 'exposing' Labor members for being the 'hypocrites' they must really be, despite all the moral pretensions of their language. What the Liberals never wanted to debate was Labor's substantive record of being the pioneers of every significant social justice reform since federation. (pg 476)<br>
    •	It was all too personally confronting to have 'successful professionals' running around who had the temerity to argue that unrestrained personal greed was not the best organising principle for a properly functioning society. (pg 476)<br>
    •	Journalists hounded Therese for her company, WorkDirections, in their smear campaign. Following her to her apartment & plane flights, they had published an article titled 'Cheap Labor: How Kevin Rudd's Wife Told Workers to Trade Away Job Conditions'. The OWS (Workplace Ombudsman) later published a report stating that 'there was no evidence of the purported removal of penalty rates, overtime or allowances... the YES employees were not underpaid because of deliberate or careless conduct by WorkDirections'. (pg 494, 502)<br>
    •	Rudd was hounded by the media on: his drunk attendance of a strip club (paint him as a hypocrite w no 'family values', Howard followed w a tirade on this), his relation to a stripper as his brother's second wife, the cause of death of his father, his own cardiac surgery (his heart valve replacement supposedly passing its use by date), Sunrise's plans to host an ANZAC ceremony in Vietnam (apparently he made the soldiers wait for him though this was unbeknownst to him, and Sunrise's responsibility)<br>
    •	'Four years ago, Rudd got drunk and took himself into a strip club. Four years ago, Howard, sober, took Australia into the Iraq War. I think the electorate can judge which one did the more harm.' (pg 512) - Bob Brown, Greens Leader<br>
    •	The ultimate exercise in political self-indulgence - Anybody can complain. But the central mission of politics is what you can do about it. (pg 521)<br>
